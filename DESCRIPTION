Title: Regression with a Large Number of Potential Explanatory Variables: An R Implementation of the Procedure Proposed by Cox, D.R. and Battey, H.S. (2017) <10.1073/Pnas.1703764114>

Description: Software for performing the reduction, exploratory and model selection phases of the procedure proposed by Cox, D.R. and Battey, H.S. (2017) <10.1073/pnas.1703764114> for sparse regression when the number of potential explanatory variables far exceeds the sample size. The software supports linear regression, likelihood-based fitting of generalized linear regression models and the proportional hazards model fitted by partial likelihood.
